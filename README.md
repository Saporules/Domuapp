# Domuapp
An app to keep track of all your domains

Developed as a personal project, the minimum value product was ready in a week and a half.

## Software:

I use Ionic 2 framework as base architecture, it uses Angular 2, and is written with Typescript.

## What's next:
Now I'm trying to get it ready for a freemium business model. For the *Pro* version I'm planning to connect the who is api for giving the user an easier way to add domains and their information.

Currently looking for investors.
